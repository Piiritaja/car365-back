    //todo A
    // What is integration?
    // Answer: combining software parts into one system.

    //todo B
    // What makes integration continuous?
    // Answer:

    //todo C
    // In the class we had 3 stages in our CI/CD process, tick [x] which ones stand for continuous integration
    // [x] compile
    // [x] test
    // [] deploy

    //todo D
    // Name and explain 1 benefit of CI
    // Testing. When contributing to a project, you want to be sure that the changes you made, do not brake the functionality of the software.
    // Also this way, providing you have meaningful tests, the underlying functionality of the software stays the same, meaning someone can not on their own make fundamental changes to the software.

    //todo E
    // Name and explain 1 drawback of CI
    // 1 Initial time cost. Setting up automated testing, writing meaningful tests, setting up runners can initially take a lot of time.

    //todo F
    // In the class we are using gitlab-ci. Name 2 alternatives to it
    // 1 Jenkins
    // 2 Github (Github actions)
