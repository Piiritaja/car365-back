    //todo A
    // What is delivery?
    // Answer: Taking the code from one source and automatically making it available in the selected testing,
    // development or end-user platforms.

    //todo B
    // What makes delivery continuous?
    // Answer: Delivery is done automatically every time that there is a change in the source.

    //todo C
    // In the class we had 3 stages in our CI/CD process, tick which ones stand for continuous delivery
    // [] compile
    // [] test
    // [x] deploy

    //todo D
    // Name and explain 1 benefit of CD
    // 1 When multiple development platforms are used for one project, CD makes it easy and quick to make changes
    // available on all of them.

    //todo E
    // Name and explain 1 drawback of CD
    // 1 Since delivery is automated, there might be some bugs that are delivered automatically which if manually
    // checked, would not have been delivered.

    //todo F
    // Which one is more important to start with CI or CD? Why?
    // CI/CD: CI
    // Because: CI ensures, that the source developers use and change is the same. Delivery can be done manually if
    // if needed, but CI is essential to keep the code working between many developers.
