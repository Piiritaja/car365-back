public class DBaaS {

    //todo A
    // What is DBaaS (Database as a service)?
    // Answer: It is a service that provides a database (in the cloud) that can be accessed remotely and does not require
    // local hardware by the user to run it.

    //todo B
    // Name 2 examples of DBaaS.
    // 1 Azure Databases
    // 2 IBM Cloud Database

    //todo C
    // Name and explain 2 benefits of using DBaaS
    // 1 Scalability: If more (or less) storage or different settings (ex. more/less powerful cpu or more/less ram)
    // are needed, it can be done through the service provider (by buying more storage, ram etc) and requires no
    // hardware or large software changes on the client(user) part.
    // 2 Price: Setting up hardware and a server to host a database is costly. DBaaS providers already have these
    // capabilities and offer cheaper prices due to "bulk" supply (a lot of servers -> cost per server is lower).

    //todo D
    // Name and explain 1 drawback of using DBaaS
    // 1  Lack of control: With the database being run in a remote server by the provider the control over the settings
    // may be more restricted than comparing to locally (by the developer) run database servers.

    //todo E
    // What other -aaS do you know?
    // 1 SaaS
    // 2 PaaS
    // 3 IaaS

    //todo F
    // In your opinion which aaS are the most useful and should be integrated first.
    // Answer: IaaS. Makes it easier to scale hardware dependent components (database, servers etc) according to
    // needs while also leaving freedom of choice in development tools.
