    //todo A
    // What is material design?
    // Answer: Material design is a design language developed by Google. It's well defined set of
    // guidelines to help both designers and end users replicate Google's work as well as explain why things
    // in Google look and respond the way they do.

    //todo B
    // Name and describe 2 principles of material design (there are more than 2)
    // 1 Everything that we design should be deliberate and big. No more wishy washy colours like beige.
    // 2 Motion can be used to help move the user and create meaning, in particular, movement is especially useful in
    // providing feedback to the user.
