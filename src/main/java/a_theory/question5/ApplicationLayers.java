    // Architects insist on having layered architecture in the back-end... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

    //todo p1
    // Name 3 layers of back-end architecture. Give a brief description for each.
    // 1 Controller
    // Description: Receives requests from external sources and answers
    // 2 Service
    // Description: Works with data, processes it, changes it, communicates it.
    // 3 Model
    // Description: Describes the data, holds the data.

    //todo p2
    // Do you agree with the architects? Why?
    // Yes/No Yes
    // Because: It makes it logical and easier to either get info from Api-s, build Api-s, understand other Api-s.
    // Standardazing makes it easier to move from project to project and still understand them quickly.

    //todo p3
    // We use objects to transport data between different layers.
    // What is the difference between Entity and Dto? What is same between them?
    // Answer: Entity is the full object that is stored in databases, Dto is used as a transfer object.
    // They both hold some data and are defined by parameters.
